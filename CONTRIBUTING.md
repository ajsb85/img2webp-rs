# Contributing to img2webp-rs

We welcome contributions! Please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Code Style**: Adhere to standard Rust formatting (`cargo fmt`).
2.  **Commits**: Use descriptive, single-line subjects for commits. Provide more context in the body if necessary.
3.  **Safety**: Since this project wraps a C library via FFI, ensure all `unsafe` blocks are well-documented and minimal.
4.  **Tests**: Add tests for new features in the `webp_anim` crate.

## Process

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Submit a Pull Request.
